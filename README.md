libft.h
# :ledger: libft.h is the header file for my custom C library called Libft. This library contains a collection of commonly used functions that replicate standard C library functions and other useful utilities.

Purpose:
The goal of Libft is to create my own versions of standard functions, practice my C programming skills, and develop a deeper understanding of how these functions work under the hood. By building these functions from scratch, I ensure that I have complete control over memory management and functionality.

Whatâ€™s inside?
String manipulation: Functions like ft_strlen, ft_strcpy, ft_strdup, ft_strjoin, and more.
Memory functions: Functions like ft_memset, ft_memcpy, ft_memmove, ft_bzero, etc.
Character checks: Functions like ft_isalpha, ft_isdigit, ft_isalnum, etc.
Utility functions: Includes ft_itoa, ft_split, ft_substr, and others.
Each of these functions is defined in their own .c files, and libft.h contains the necessary prototypes and includes to make everything work together.

How to use?
To use Libft, include the libft.h header file in your project and compile the .c files. You can link this custom library with your project to access the functions: #include "libft.h 
This library is meant to be modular and reusable, making it a great tool for future C projects!

Why create this?
This project helps me improve my coding abilities, understand standard C libraries better, and prepare for more complex projects by mastering foundational skills. The functions in Libft are written from scratch, ensuring that I fully grasp each concept.
